I am a highly motivated and creative Front-End Developer.

Passionate about technology, coding and learning new things. My whole journey of becoming a developer started when I moved here to Canada from Macedonia 4 years ago. I have a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Informatics but everything I've learned about Web is self-taught. I chose this path because it requires continuous learning and self-improvement.

My many goals are to expand my horizon, attend conferences/meetings and meet many great people.
