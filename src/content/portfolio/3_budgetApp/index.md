Here you can manage your monthly budget. In this app, you can insert income, add expenses and it will calculate how much budget you have left, also will show you the percentage from each expense that will be calculated from the whole budget. I created this cause I wanted to play with JavaScript Modules and I configured Webpack so the files can talk to each outer.
